# LayerKit Change Log

## 0.23.3

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the client might fail to start synchronization process for a conversation upon receiving a remote notification. [APPS-2595]
* Fixes an issue where the client might throw an exception ("Cannot initialize synchronization manager with `nil` databaseManager.") when transitioning the app from the background into the foreground.
* Fixes an issue where the client wouldn't finish synchronizing content when woken up by a remote notification with an error "Synchronization from a remote notification could not be completed because synchronization failed to finish in 15 seconds.".
* `LYRIdentity` object identifier attribute now correctly escapes the `userID` string (this includes the following characters: `:;#@`). [APPS-2627]
* Fixes an issue where the authenticated user's identity (when accessing `client.authenticatedUser`) might lose all the information (`firstName`, `lastName`, `displayName`, `metadata`... ended up being `nil`). [APPS-2630]

#### Public API Changes

* Made the `createdAt` attribute on the `LYRConversation` nullable, which solves the issues with Swift.
* Removed dead code around the `LYRActor` class.
* Updated `LYRQueryController` header documentation.

## 0.23.2

#### Bug Fixes

* The `isConnecting` method of `LYRClient` objects will no longer return `YES` when `isConnected` is also true.
* Conversation metadata changes more consistent across clients, when mutating it from multiple clients at once.

## 0.23.1

#### Public API Changes

* `LYRQueryController` objects now permit the developer to invoke `execute:` and `executeWithCompletion:` multiple times. This allows for the reconfiguration of queries by mutating the `predicate` or `sortDescriptors` properties of the `LYRQuery` object driving the controller.
* Setting the `paginationWindow` of an `LYRQueryController` object to zero will now raise an `NSInvalidArgumentException`.
* The `LYRClientDelegate` method `layerClient:didSwitchToSession:` and `LYRClientDidSwitchSessionNotification` now only get called when client switches between sessions. Previously the client would also notify of the session switch when authenticating for the first time. [APPS-2584]

#### Bug Fixes

* Attempting to wait for an invalid object identifier with the appropriate prefix and number of components (i.e. `layer:///invalid/1234`) will now return an error instead of crashing.
* Fixes the crash in `LYRClient` creation process, where the internal logic tries to create a background `NSURLSession` and fails to compare the session's delegate with self. This happens due to 3rd party libraries (like Crittercism) that use method swizzling and `NSProxy` objects on `NSURLSessionDelegate`, which causes the pointer comparison to fail. [APPS-2581]
* The `LYRClient` method `waitForCreationOfObjectWithIdentifier:timeout:completion:` is now guaranteed to always invoke the completion block on the main thread.

## 0.23.0

#### Public API Changes

* The prefix for identifier URIs on `LYRIdentity` objects has changed from `layer:///identity/` to `layer:///identities/`. [APPS-2403]
* The `LYRClient` method `connectWithCompletion:` will no longer return `NO` and an error when an authentication challenge is encountered.
* Deauthenticating the client will no longer result in transport being disconnected.
* Query controllers will no longer emit will and did change notifications if the result set did not change.

#### Enhancements

* Introduced `allObjects` method on `LYRQueryController` to allow access to all matching objects. [APPS-2470]
* The `createdAt` property of `LYRConversation` is now a synchronized value. [APPS-2433]
* Event publication is now prioritized at the network level over data retrieval, resulting in faster message sends during cold sync.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where Layer client would not synchronize the full conversation when user gets added to an existing conversation. [APPS-2406]
* Fixes an issue where Layer client might crash when a conversation got deleted by another participant. [APPS-2406]
* Fixes an issue where invoking `[client setDebuggingEnabled:YES]` would make the Client duplicate log lines in the log file.
* Fixes an issue where Layer client might crash during the synchronization process due to an internal collection mutation during enumeration. [APPS-2406]
* Fixes an issue where Layer client might crash during transport transitions (e.g. from WiFi to Cellular) or when de-authenticating the client. [APPS-2499]
* Querying using the `In` or `NotIn` predicates with a non-collection value now returns an error instead of throwing an exception. [APPS-2506]
* Transport is now disconnected when background time expires to prevent a transient issue with hung sockets.
* Fixes an issue where Layer client might download the same rich content multiple times causing high network bandwidth and CPU usage. [APPS-2511]
* Fixes an issue where concurrent operations may crash due to thread-safety violations.
* Fixes an issue where the synchronization process would get caught in an infinite loop trying to download rich content and applying the updates to the `LYRMessagePart` instance. [APPS-2517]
* Fixed an issue where transport would not be suspended upon entering the background if you are in the midst of connecting.
* Fixed an issue where auto-detection of an HTTPS proxy would result in connection errors such as "No endpoints available, unable to connect socket". [APPS-2523]
* Fixed a crash in `LYRConversation` `markAllMessagesAsRead:` method. [APPS-2510]
* Fixes a crash in the synchronization process related to a conversation created using the Layer CAPI. [APPS-2527]
* Fixes a crash in the synchronization process related to conversation deletions. [APPS-2541]
* Querying for an empty metadata dictionary will now return only conversations without metadata instead of all conversations. [APPS-2447]
* Fixes an issue where Layer client would ignore the rich content auto-download settings after connecting. [APPS-2545]
* Fixes an issue where the `LYRConversation`'s '`totalNumberOfMessages` would yield the wrong number even on a fully synchronized client.
* Request failures within `authenticateWithIdentityToken:completion:` were incorrectly handled as status code mismatches. The correct errors are now returned. [APPS-2548]
* In cases where participants would send messages back and forth at a higher frequency the messages could get out of order. [APPS-2551]
* Client won't issue authentication challenges during the de-authentication process anymore. [APPS-2553]
* Fixes a crash when deserializing metadata with conflicting keys which could happen due to a server-side race condition. [APPS-2550]
* Query controllers that have not been executed will no longer emit delegate updates. [APPS-2560]
* Fixes background rich content transfers which could get stuck. [APPS-2557]

## 0.22.0

This release includes a number of public API changes to make development with LayerKit easier and more expressive in Swift. We have added real classes and types for configuration `options` that previously accepted dictionaries and modeled typing indicators as a class.

#### Public API Changes

* Introduced the `LYRClientOptions` object which provides for configuring synchronization options for an `LYRClient` instance.
* The `LYRClient` initialization method has been changed. It now takes an `LYRClientDelegate` instance which is required and the options argument has changed from `NSDictionary` to `LYRClientOptions`.
* Renamed `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicyMessageCount` to `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicyPartialHistory`.
* Introduced the `LYRConversationOptions` object meant for configuring conversation instance upon initialization. It replaces the `LYRConversationOptionsMetadataKey`, `LYRConversationOptionsDeliveryReceiptsEnabledKey` and `LYRConversationOptionsDistinctByParticipantsKey` which was previously passed through the options argument with a dictionary.
* Introduced the `LYRMessageOptions` object meant for configuring message instance upon initialization. It replaces the `LYRMessageOptionsPushNotificationConfigurationKey`, which was previously passed through the options argument with a dictionary.
* Introduced the `LYRTypingIndicator` object that gets bundles in the `userInfo` of the `LYRConversationDidReceiveTypingIndicatorNotification`. It replaces the previously `NSNumber` wrapped typing indicator ENUM values that were bundled in the notification's `userInfo`.

#### Enhancements

* Improved performance of messaging after the initial synchronization finishes.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the client wouldn't synchronize a newly received conversation, if the app is brought into the foreground by a remote notification.
* Fixes a crash that could happen during the synchronization process, when processing deleted conversations.
* Fixes an issue where the client would synchronize the complete history, even when configured with a different synchronization policy.
* Fixed a crash in the `LYRExternalContentPreparationOperation` that occurs during cancellation of a Rich Content transfer. [APPS-2476]

## 0.21.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a client would receive a new config bag and ignore overwriting the changes in the synchronization logic, which would result in messages not getting published (stuck in pending).

#### Enhancements

* Added a more descriptive logging to message publication logic.

## 0.21.0

#### Enhancements

* Introduced `LYRSession` class to provide applications with the ability to manage multiple user sessions simultaneously.
* Added functionality to allow applications to switch user sessions without deauthenticating.
* Performance improvement in the synchronization process.

#### Public API Changes

* Added `LYRSession` object.
* Added `currentSession` property to `LYRClient`.
* Added `sessions` property to `LYRClient`.
* Added `newSessionWithIdentifier:` method to `LYRClient`.
* Added `sessionWithUserIdentifier:` method to `LYRClient`.
* Added `switchToSession:error:` method to `LYRClient`.
* Added `destroySession:error:` method to `LYRClient`.
* Deprecated `addPolicy:error:` in favor of `addPolicies:error:` and `removePolicy:error:` in favor of `removePolicies:error:` which provides for performing bulk policy operations.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the client might crash with an exception ('Task created in a session that has been invalidated') during the de-authentication process or then disconnecting the client by hand.
* Fixes an issue where the client might crash with `EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)` when it's downloading a lot of message parts at the time.
* Fixes an issue which caused the client to improperly handle calls to `addPolicy:error` or `removePolicy:error:` when called multiple times in rapid succession.
* Fixes an issue where the client might crash when trying to handle an internal error.
* Fixes an issue that could prevent a client from reauthenticating after receiving an authentication challenge.
* Fixes an issue that could lead to a crash during multiple calls to `deauthenticateWithCompletion:`.
* Fixes an issue where the client could materialize a deleted conversation with no messages.

## 0.20.5

#### Enhancements

* Added support for querying for `nil` values with the `IsEqualTo` and `IsNotEqual` predicate operators.
* Performance improvements and enhancements.

## 0.20.4

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where some clients had an invalid database state.

## 0.20.3

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where some clients received conversations with `nil` participants.
* Fixes an issue where properties could be improperly set on `LYRConversation` objects.
* Fixes an issue where in some cases the `totalNumberOfMessages` and `totalNumberOfUnreadMessages` values in `LYRConversation` instance wouldn't get updated correctly.
* Fixes an issue where client wouldn't synchronize the history of a conversation after the user has been added to an existing conversation.
* Fixes an issue where a client potentially wouldn't delete a message when deleted with the `LYRDeletionModeAllParticipants` option by another participant.

## 0.20.2

#### Enhancements

* Added functionality to allow users to "leave" a conversation. This has the effect of removing the user from the conversation and and deleting the conversation from all of the authenticated user's devices.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where creating a new unique conversation with the same participants of a deleted conversation caused outgoing messages to be stuck in pending.
* Fixed an issue where message send could pass validation after participant had been removed from the conversation.

#### Public API Changes

* Client's default sync policy is now `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicyUnreadOnly`, if the policy is not specified in the options argument of the client's designated initializer. Deprecated initializer however will keep the old behaviour, which is the `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicyCompleteHistory`.
* Added `leave:` method to `LYRConversation`.

#### Enhancements

* Improvements to synchronization performance when deleting content with `LYRDeletionModeMyDevices`.

## 0.20.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes a bug where `LYRConversation`'s `-synchronizeMoreMessages:error:` method would allow to pass zero messages as the first argument; it's now enforced with a validation that passes an error and returns `NO`.
* Fixes a bug that would cause `LYRClient` to ignore the initialization option `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicyUnreadOnly`.

#### Public API Changes

* The client's `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` now immediately returns `NO` if the remote notification payload is not meant for the `LYRClient` or if the method has been invoked while the application is in a fully active state -- in this case, the completion handler won't be called.

## 0.20.0

#### Enhancements

* Layer client can be configured to avoid fully synchronizing the conversation history. It also provides all the necessary functionallity to load more historic content on demand. See `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicy`.
* Introduced `LYRIdentity` to synchronize user identity with the Layer Client.
* `waitForCreationOfObjectWithIdentifier:timeout:completion:` will now query for an existing object with the given identifier in the local database and return it immediately upon invocation. This prevents a timeout from triggering in race condition cases where an object is materialized before the wait invocation is made (typically via transport push).

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue that would prevent the  `LYRQueryControllerDelegate` from reporting changes to a `conversation.lastMesssage` property.
* Fixed a performance issue where the client performed extra work when it synchronized conversations, which in case of a high volume of conversations looked like a delay in the initial synchronization process.

### Public API Changes

* Added synchronization policies to the client's initialization method: `+clientWithAppID:options:`, see `LYRClientSynchronizationPolicy`.
* In case the `LYRClient` is initalized to perform a partial synchronization process, more historic messages can be loaded on demand by either calling `LYRConversation`'s `synchronizeMoreMessages:error:` or `synchronizeAllMessages:` method.
* `LYRConversation` contains two new properties that tell how many messages in total are available or how many unread messages are available in the conversation (even if the client hasn't fully synchronized the history of a conversation).
* A set of two new notification are introduced that inform when a synchronization process is about to begin `LYRConversationWillBeginSynchronizingNotification` (handing out an `LYRProgress` instance in the userInfo of the notification), and a notification indicating that the synchronization process has completed `LYRConversationDidFinishSynchronizingNotification`.
* Introduced `LYRIdentity` which replaces `LYRActor` and represents a first class object synchronized by the provider with the Layer platform.
* `LYRMessage` property `sender` returns an object of type `LYRIdentity`.
* `LYRConversation` property `participants` returns objects of type `LYRIdentity`.
* Added `LYRClient` methods `followUserIDs:error:` and `unfollowUserIDs:error:` that allows for explicit following and unfollowing of userIDs to synchronize available identity information with the client. Followed userIDs will receive updates made to that identity, while unfollowing stops all updates and deletes the identity. All conversation participants are implicitly followed and cannot be explicitly followed or unfollowed.
* Introduced `LYRPredicateOperatorLike` that allows for `LIKE` wildcard querying on `LYRIdentity` properties `firstName`, `lastName`, `displayName`, and `emailAddress`.
* `LYRClient` property `authenticatedUserID` has been replaced with `LYRIdentity` object authenticatedUser.
* `LYRClient` method `authenticateWithIdentityToken:completion:` has its completion block parameter changed from a string to a `LYRIdentity` object.
* `LYRClient` method `newConversationWithParticipants:options:error:` now checks for blocked participants when creating a 1:1 conversations. An attempt to create a conversation with a blocked participant will result in an error.

## 0.19.4

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an internal concurrency issue that caused crashes during synchronization.

## 0.19.3

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where messages failed to sync in response to push notifications.

## 0.19.2

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the cold-sync process could get stuck.
* Fixes an issue where `LYRMessagePart.index` would always be `0`.
* Fixes an issue where a crash could occur after a conversation is deleted.
* Fixed an issue where messages could not be deleted in the `LYRDeletionModeMyDevices` mode after removal from the conversation.
* Fixes an issue where a message part transfer might get stuck on `LYRContentTransferDownloading` status.
* Fixes an issue where a message might be stuck in a "pending" state after an application crash, until a new message is sent.
* Fixes an issue where an `LYRQueryController` could report changes in a non serial manner. Query controller will now report an error if `execute:` is called while an update is currently in flight.

## 0.19.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` would return an error when invoked when the app is in an inactive state.
* Updated keychain items to allow access when executing in the background.
* LayerKit now uses an alternate global symbol for logging to avoid conflicts with CocoaLumberjack.

## 0.19.0

#### Public API Changes

* Removed all deprecated `LayerKit` methods.
* Replacing the completion block in `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion` to return the `LYRConversation` and `LYRMessage` objects specified in the remote payload instead of the object changes.
* Introduced `LYRClient` method `waitForCreationOfObjectWithIdentifier:timeout:completion:` that waits the timeout length for creation of the specified identifier's object.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue which caused `LYRQueryController` instances to return partially hydrated objects. This could occur when multiple query controllers were attempting to query the same objects from different threads.

## 0.18.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue that would cause the `LYRQueryController` to broadcast `UPDATE` events with a `newIndexPath` parameter.
* Fixes an issue that could lead to a crash when syncing conversations that contain blocked participants.

## 0.18.0

#### Public API Changes

* Introduced a new deletion mode `LYRDeletionModeMyDevices`, which provides for synchronizing a conversation or message deletion among all of a users devices.
* Deprecated `LYRDeletionModeLocal` in favor of `LYRDeletionModeMyDevices`.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where attempting to remove a participant would return `TRUE` when the participant was not a participant in the conversation.
* Fixes an issue that caused the `isSent` property of received messages to not get updated immediately upon receipt.

## 0.17.7

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the `LYRClient` initializer would return nil in certain scenarios when an application is in the background.

## 0.17.6

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where iOS would kill the app when kept in the background state for long enough.
* Fixes an issue where the SDK loses the accessibility of the database files in background when phone is locked and passcode protected, due to iOS data protection. A private build of "sqlite3" built with the SDK was replaced by using the system-wide available "sqlite3lib" library.

## 0.17.5

#### Public API changes

* Loosened the type constraint on `+clientWithAppID:` method to allow null returns.
* Fixed the conversation metadata generics (which was broken with the previous release of LayerKit).

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where transitioning the app to background could cause a deadlock on the main thread.
* Fixes an issue where de-authenticating a client during a high activity of rich content transfers would crash the client.

## 0.17.4

#### Public API changes

* Added nullability annotations and type hints to the public API for Objective C generics.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes the issue where a locally deleted conversation gets restored without metadata.
* Fixes an issue which could prevent creating new conversations.
* Fixes compatibility issues with XCode 7.2.

#### Enhancements

* Client tries to keep the connection open even if the app gets completely suspended, which results in faster resumption when app is brought into the foreground.

## 0.17.3

#### Bug Fixes

* Improved stability of the SDK.
* Fixes the assertion issue related to receiving distinct conversations with the same set of participants after a conversation with the same set of participants was deleted.
* Fixes the issue that would cause the `Failed to persist a stream with client_id = nil` assertion.
* Fixes the intermittent conversation metadata update failures.
* Fixes a potential crash related with participant removal.
* Fixes the issue where deleting an active (chatty) conversation might raise an exception.

## 0.17.2

#### Enhancements

* Improved the performance of the cold synchronization process.
* Improved the memory footprint LayerKit makes in the cold sync scenarios and when the LYRClient needs to deal with a high volume of conversations.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the potential crashes related to `UITableView` or `UICollectionView` that the `LYRQueryController` could cause by reporting incorrect number of objects.
* Fixed the `LYRPolicy` object's hashing logic, which helps collections identify the objects.
* Fixed memory leaks caused by LayerKit.
* Fixed bug which would prevent announcements from being marked as read.
* Conversations will now contain all metadata immediately after they are created.

## 0.17.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the observer crash when initializing the LYRClient and protected data is unavailable.
* `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` now passes an error via completion block, in case the method is invoked while the app is in the foreground.
* Fixed an issue where announcements appeared as messages in its own conversation or weren't received at all.

#### Enhancements

* Synchronization process doesn't slow down anymore as conversations grow.

## 0.17.0

#### Dynamic Framework Support

`LayerKit 0.17.0` introduces support for distributing LayerKit as a [dynamic framework](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.36/). To prepare your project for dynamic framework support, please ensure you perform the following:

* Upgrade your local version of `CocoaPods` to `0.39.0` or greater.
* Add [`use_frameworks!`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang) to the top of your `Podfile`.
* Ensure that your project's iOS deployment target is iOS 8.0 or greater. Dynamic frameworks are not supported prior to iOS 8.0.
* Change any `LayerKit` header import statements to following format: `<LayerKit/LayerKit.h>`. When building dynamic frameworks with `CocoaPods`, you may no longer use quoted imports.

#### Public API changes

* LayerKit client now uses message parts' MIMEType to resolve its filename extension for the rich content which is accessible through `(LYRMessagePart *)part.fileURL`.
* `LYRClientWillBeginSynchronizationNotification` now includes a progress object instance in the `userInfo` as the value to the `LYRClientSynchronizationProgressUserInfoKey`.
* Introduced `LYRPushNotificationConfiguration` for default and per recipient push notification configuration.
* The `LYRMessageOptionsPushNotificationAlertKey` and `LYRMessageOptionsPushNotificationPerRecipientConfigurationKey` keys have been deprecated for the `LYRMessageOptionsPushNotificationConfigurationKey` key, which takes an instance of `LYRPushNotificationConfiguration` to allow extended push customization.
* `LYRClientWillBeginSynchronizationNotification` now comes with a `userInfo` dictionary that contains an `LYRProgress` instance (under the `LYRClientContentTransferProgressUserInfoKey`) that tracks the progress of the cold-synchronization process.

#### Enhancements

* Rewritten the synchronization queuing logic that parallelizes processing per conversation.
* More reliable push notification handling when using the `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` method
* Added support for building LayerKit as a dynamic framework.
* Added support for bitcode.

## 0.16.0

#### Public API Changes

* `LYRQueryController` initialization on the `LYRClient` changes from `queryControllerWithQuery:` to `queryControllerWithQuery:error:` to return an error when the client isn't authenticated and a controller can't be created.
* `LYRQuery` now supports `LYRConversation` querying on property `metadata` in dictionary and key path forms.
* LayerKit client now tries to resolve message parts' MIMEType and uses an appropriate filename extension for the rich content `(LYRMessagePart *)part.fileURL`.

#### Bugfix

* Ensure `LYRMessagePart` `fileURL` property is updated when `LYRProgress` `fractionCompleted` is 1.
* Fixed `LayerKit` connection issue when XCode Product Name contained a unicode character.
* Fixed a minor memory leak when interacting with the Keychain APIs.

#### Enhancements

* Updated exception language when an invalid parameter is supplied to an `LYRQuery`.
* Updated error language when attempting to authenticate with an invalid nonce.
* Adding metadata querying support.

## 0.15.0

#### Public API Changes

* Changed `LYRClient` initializer to accept an `NSURL` object for the `appID` parameter.
* Changed `appID` property type from `NSUUID` to `NSURL` on `LYRClient`.

#### Enhancements

* Introduced file protection with `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` for all `LayerKit` files.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue which caused a crash when calling `objectAtIndexPath:` on an empty `LYRQueryController`.

## 0.14.3

#### Enhancements

* When transitioning to background `LYRClient` now keeps the messaging services running for as long as iOS allows the app to run in the background.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where `LYRMessagePart`s hold outdated objects in memory, where updating it can throw exceptions due to mismatched version number.
* Fixes an issue where deleting conversation metadata at key path didn't work.
* Fixes an issue which caused LayerKit to indefinitely retry conversation creation after receiving an unrecoverable error from server.
* Fixes an issue where the `LYRClient` would auto-purge most of the downloaded content when setting the `client.diskCapacity` property.

## 0.14.2

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where creating a query controller mutates a collection the client is enumerating.

## 0.14.1

#### Public API Changes

* Introduced `LYRConversation` query predicate and sort descriptor `lastMessage.sentAt`, which joins the already existing `lastMessage.receivedAt`.

#### Enhancements

* Added logic to speed up synchronization of conversation deletions and metadata updates.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where deleted conversations with pending changes caused the sync to completely stop.
* Fixes an issue where mutlitple local deletions and distinct conversation creations could create object cache inconsistencies and crash.
* Fixes an issue which caused `LayerKit` to return `nil` instead of `NSUIntegerMax` if an error occurred during a count query.

## 0.14.0

#### Enhancements

* Introduced Announcements, special Messages sent to all users of the application or to a list of users that will arrive outside of the context of a conversation. Announcements can only be sent through the Platform API.
* Introduced the ability to create a single distinct conversations between participants. This will prevent duplicate conversations if multiple users try to create conversations with each other at the same time. See Public API Changes for more details. Distinct conversations are now the default when creating new conversations. All conversations created before v0.14 are set to be non-distinct.

#### Public API Changes

* Added `LYRAnnouncement`, which models a platform message sent externally from any conversation.  `LYRAnnouncement` subclasses `LYRMessage` and is queryable by itself.  This works in conjunction with the Platform API.
* Added `LYRConversationOptionsDistinctByParticipantsKey` to `LYRConversation` as a key for the conversation `options` initilization parameter. Setting the value for this key to `YES` during initialization will guarantee that Layer only ever creates a single conversation for the specified participants. `YES` is also default if no options are specified.
* Added `isDistinct` property to `LYRConversation` to indicate whether or not the conversation is distinct by its participant list.

## 0.13.3

#### Public API Changes

* Introduced `LYRObjectChange`, which models a change that has occured upon a Layer model object. This object replaces the change dictionaries that `LYRClient` posted with change notifications.
* Deprecated the following object change dictionary keys: `LYRObjectChangeTypeKey`, `LYRObjectChangeObjectKey`, `LYRObjectChangePropertyKey`, `LYRObjectChangeOldValueKey`, `LYRObjectChangeNewValueKey`. Use the public properties on `LYRObjectChange` instead.

#### Enhancements

* Improved the performance of the Rich Content management (smaller memory footprint and CPU usage).
* Prioritized auto-download scheduling of message parts with Rich Content.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed crash caused by attempting to add a participant to a conversation they are already in.
* Fixed crash caused by attempting to remove a participant from a conversation they are not in.
* Fixed crash when dealing with huge numbers of Rich Content parts.
* Fixed an issue where sent messages' recipient statuses seemed to be stuck on `LYRRecipientStatusPending`, even though messages were successfully sent.

## 0.13.2

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug that prevented `LYRClient` objects from being properly deallocated.

## 0.13.2

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug that would cause messages to not be marked as read when calling `markAllMessagesAsRead:` on `LYRConversation`.
* Fixed bug with object faulting causing message parts to be released.

## 0.13.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed crash during synchronization caused by improperly set error pointers.
* Fixed crash during synchronization caused by fetching thousands of conversations at a time.
* Fixed crash caused by a Layer Client being deauthenticated while trying to mark messages as read.
* Fixed bug that could cause message recipient status to not update properly.

## 0.13.0

#### Enhancements

* Added the ability to receive messages from non-human actors via the Layer Platform API.
* Implemented partial object faulting to lower memory footprint.
* Added `LYRRecipientStatusPending` to the `LYRRecipientStatus` enumeration to align more closely with Layer Android SDK.

#### Bug Fixes

* Changed the behavior of `recipientStatusByUserID` such that the status for each recipient is `LYRRecipientStatusPending` rather than `LYRRecipientStatusSent` when a message is awaiting transport.

#### Public API Changes

* The `LYRMessage` property `sentByUserID` has been deprecated.
* The `LYRActor` object `sender` is a new property on `LYRMessage` to support non-human actors.  The `sender` has two mutually exclusive properties, `userID` and `name`.  `userID` is the user ID of a participant that sends a message, and `name` is the name specified from a platform non-human message sent in a conversation.

## 0.12.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Cleaned up numerous memory leaks across the sync engine and Rich Content manager.
* Fixed issues in the database access layer to avoid busy and lock errors under high concurrency.

## 0.12.0

#### Enhancements

* Changed several APIs to improve interoperability with Swift.
* Improved synchronization performance, if client has a lot of messages with rich content to sync.
* Improved message send times while performing sync.

#### Public API Changes

* The `LYQuery` initializer has been changed from `queryWithClass:` to `queryWithQueryableClass:`. This avoids the need to wrap `class` in backticks when initializing a query object in Swift.
* The `LYRPredicate` initializer has been changed from `predicateWithProperty:operator:value:` to `predicateWithProperty:predicateOperator:value:`. This avoids the need to wrap `operator` in backticks when initializing a predicate object in Swift.
* `updateRemoteNotificationDeviceToken:error:` now accepts a `nil` value as the `deviceToken` parameter. This un-registers devices from receiving push notifications.
* Multiple `LYRClient` instances created with the same appID are not allowed anymore, doing so will cause an assertion.
* Added `markMessagesAsRead:error:` to `LYRClient` to facilitate batch operations.
* Update `LYRMessagePart` initializers to enforce MIME Type format using the regular expression "/^[^\\s/]+/[^\\s/]+$/". This ensures that Rich Content message parts do not get stuck during upload due to having an invalid MIME Type.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where background transfers only worked when device had sufficient power and a WiFi connection.
* Fixes a crash that occurs if `LYRClient` is instantiated under `XCTestCase` unit tests.
* Fixes an issue where a revived locally deleted conversation isn't operating correctly (previously it didn't include messages it had previously and didn't process public API requests correctly).
* Fixes an issue where `providerUserIDs` with slashes made the client crash, if in use with rich-content (content that is >2kb).
* Fixed an issue where metadata would synchronize incorrectly in certain cases. (Merged fix from maintenance release v0.9.10)

## 0.11.2

#### Enhancements

* Added new helper method to the query controller for looking up the index paths of objects given a set of identifiers.
* Integrated new logging and debugging facilities.

## 0.11.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Removes a Podfile change that was allowing LayerKit to be referenced as a transitive dependency in Swift projects when it would fail at build time.
* Fixed an issue where failed operations would fail to revert objects to their pre-error state.
* Fixed an issue where a deleted Conversation that received new Messages would fail to return to an active state.
* Reverted packaging changes that caused installation issues under non-CocoaPods installations.

## 0.11.0

This version of LayerKit includes a substantial change to Message ordering in order to enhance performance. Previous version of LayerKit utilized
a property named `index`, which was a monotonically increasing integer equal to the number of Messages that had been synchronized. From v0.11.0 on,
LayerKit maintains a new property named `position`. The `position` of a Message is a value that is calculated immediately when the Message is
synchronized and never changes. This greatly improves performance by reducing the change notification overhead associated with syncing large amounts
of Message content.

#### Public API Changes

* Dropped the `index` property on the `LYRMessage` object in favor of `position` which orders the messages in a conversation more efficiently.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue where background transfers weren't handled in time, which caused the SDK to loose the downloaded file and retry the transfer.

## 0.10.3

#### Enhancements

* Changed distribution packaging to Dynamic iOS Framework.
* Compatibility with CocoaPods v0.36.0.

## 0.10.2

#### Enhancements

* Limited the number of Rich Content transfers that can be in flight at once to 5 uploads and 15 downloads.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where processing of pushed events could block the network thread, slowing down transport unnecessarily.

## 0.10.1

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where some objects didn't had their properties changed, even though the changes coming from `layerClient:objectsDidChange:` in the dictionary dictated so.
* Fixed an issue where transitioning from foreground to background made `LYRProgress` instances stale (stopped tracking upload and download transfers).

## 0.10.0

This is a major new release of LayerKit that includes support for Rich Content. Rich Content is a large file or media asset
transported and synchronized by a new agent designed specifically to handle large payloads. Rich Content assets can be up to 2GB in size
and are handled transparently by the `LYRMessage` and `LYRMessagePart` models. Rich Content is discussed in detail in the
[v0.10.0 Transition Guide](http://developer.layer.com/docs/guides#richcontent).

#### Enhancements

* Added support for transporting messages with parts of up to 2GB in size.
* Added support for querying for `LYRMessagePart` objects.
* Added support for managing the disk space utilization of message parts.
* Added support for transfering the content of message parts while the app is in background via integration with the iOS Background Transfer Service.

#### Public API changes

* New property `autodownloadMIMETypes` on `LYRClient` which enables the client to automatically start the content downloads for message parts with specific MIME Types.
* New property `autodownloadMaximumContentSize` on `LYRClient` which enables the client to automatically start the content downloads for message parts that match the size criteria.
* New method `[LYRMessagePart downloadContent:]` which requests the client to manually download a message part.
* New method `[LYRMessagePart purgeContent:]` which requests the client to purge content from disk to save disk space (note: content is retrievable via downloadContent: method).
* New property `backgroundContentTransferEnabled` on `LYRClient` that enables support for background transfers.
* New method `[LYRClient handleBackgroundContentTransfersForSession:completion:]` used for background transfer handling.
* New property `diskCapacity` on `LYRClient` which provides support for disk utilization control.
* New property `currentDiskUtilization` on `LYRClient` which provides information on how much disk space is in use by message part content.
* New properties `transferStatus` and `progress` on `LYRMessagePart` that indicate the transfer state and its progress and `fileURL` that can be used to open the message part's content as file.
* New interface `LYRProgress` that tracks and reports progress of upload and download transfers.
* New interface `LYRAggregateProgress` meant for `LYRProgress` aggregation.

#### Bug Fixes

* The client will now suppress "Connection reset by peer" transport errors that occur when a connection is lost and reconnection is triggered.

## 0.9.10

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where metadata would synchronize incorrectly in certain cases.

## 0.9.9

#### Bug Fixes

* Added countermeasures to ensure that multiple synchronization requests from rapidly delivered push notifications do not get lost.
* Backported a fix from 0.10.0 [110bdaa] that fixes the issue where an exception might be raised because of an internal race condition.

## 0.9.8

#### Bug Fixes

* The value of `receivedAt` is now set immediately upon send for `LYRMessage` objects. This improves sorting behaviors using the attribute.
* Locally deleted conversation weren't brought back, if client received new incoming messages.

## 0.9.7

#### Enhancements

* Introduced new `LYRPolicy` object for configuring communication policies. The first policy available is blocking, which enables users to block message delivery from other abusive users.

## 0.9.6

#### Bug Fixes

* The authenticated user is no longer implicitly included in the queried value for queries with the `LYRPredicateOperatorIsIn` or `LYRPredicateOperatorIsNotIn` operator on the `participants` property of the `LYRConversation` class. This prevents the query from erroneously matching or excluding all Conversations because the authenticated user is always a participant.
* Fixed `LYRQueryController` notifying its delegate that the query controller's content will/did change even when the changes do not affect the query controller's content.
* Fixed an issue where metadata change notifications would be published before the conversation had been created.
* Fixed an issue where transport state could get out of sync and result in messaging services being unavailable.
* Objects inserted outside the bounds of the pagination window of an `LYRQueryController` will no longer cause the pagination window to expand.
* Fixed an issue where removing a participant and adding them to a conversation back would fail.
* Fixed an issue where object changes would not be cleared after publication through certain codepaths. This could lead to duplicated changes or failure to notify of changes for properties that reverted to a previous value. This was most noticable on changes to `hasUnreadMessages` for Conversations, but could affect any changable property.
* Fixed an issue where querying for conversations with specific set of participants produced unpredictable results if some participants were removed from conversations.

## 0.9.5

#### Enhancements

* Introduced a new option for `LYRConversation` to allow developers to configure whether or not delivery receipts are generated on a per-conversation basis. This provides improved synchronization performance for conversations that do not utilize delivery receipts.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where locally deleted messages were not properly excluded from unread calculations.
* Fixed an issue where metadata changes would not trigger local change notifications or dispatch synchronization immediately upon change.
* Fixed an issue where metadata would attempt to synchronize for conversations that you are no longer a member of.

## 0.9.4

#### Public API changes

* The completion block of `LYRClient synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` has been changed. Instead of invoking the completion handler with a `UIBackgroundFetchResult` and an `NSError`, an `NSArray` of object changes and an `NSError` are now given. The `NSArray` contains `NSDictionary` instances that detail the exact changes made to the object model.

#### Enhancements

* The `LYRClient` class now includes a watchdog timer that ensures that connection and synchronization in response to push notifications does not exceed 15 seconds of wall clock time. This ensures that ample time is available for processing synchronized changes and prevents the application from being penalized by iOS for exceeding the 30 seconds allotted for processing the push.
* LayerKit now keeps its transport active on transition to the background for as long as permitted by iOS. This enables for the faster synchronization of incoming messages from push notifications.
* Object changes are now delivered directly to the push notification synchronization callback to facilitate easier processing.
* Enhanced the query controller by introducing the `paginationWindow` property, which enables simple pagination of the complete result set. This feature can be used to implement pull to refresh, "Load More" buttons, or automatic loading of additional objects during scrolling. See the comments on the `LYRQueryController` class for more details.
* Enhanced the query controller by introducing the `updatableProperties` property, which provides control over which properties should generate update notifications. This can be used to enhance UI performance through the elision of uninteresting updates. See the comments on the `LYRQueryController` class for more details.
* Added new `diagnosticDescription` method to `LYRClient` that dumps a report of the client's internal state for debugging. This method is not in the public header, but can be invoked via `valueForKeyPath:`.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where LayerKit would not shut down transport after succesfully connecting and sychronizing in response to a push notification.
* Fixed an issue where authentication challenges encountered by transport were not handled properly.
* Fixed an issue where LayerKit would not emit a callback from `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` if a connection could not be established.
* Fixes an issue where the query controller would emit unnecessary update notifications for objects that were created or deleted.

## 0.9.3

#### Enhancements

* The `sentByUserID` property of `LYRMessage` objects is now populated immediately upon send.
* The `LYRQuery` class now includes a detailed `description` implementation that describes the query.
* Added support for importing LayerKit into Swift based projects using CocoaPods v0.36.0+ by including umbrella module header.

#### Bug Fixes

* The `receivedAt` time is now set immediately upon message delivery.
* The query controller now dispatches move events for queries against `lastMessage.receivedAt`.
* Fixed a crash when an attempt is made to mark all messages read on a conversation that has been concurrently deleted.
* Fixed an issue that could result in changes failing to be merged onto in memory objects.
* All methods on `LYRClient` that cannot be used when unauthenticated now return appropriate errors.
* Fixed an issue where previously deleted metadata keys would fail to synchronize when subsequently restored by setting a new value.
* Updated several `LYRClient` authentication delegate callbacks to guarantee invocation on the main thread.

## 0.9.2

#### Enhancements

* Improved concurrency and error handling in the persistence layer.
* Added `canonicalObjectIdentifierForIdentifier:` to `LYRClient` to help with migrating externally stored object identifier references to the new schema.
* Synchronization in response to remote notification via `synchronizeWithRemoteNotification:completion:` now guarantees delivery of the completion callback on the main thread.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a SQLite build issue that increased exposure to database busy / locked errors.
* SQLite busy / locked errors are now immediately propagated back from any query that encounters them, ensuring queries and result sets completely succeed or fail.
* Attempts to set metadata on key-paths where the nested parents did not yet exist would fail silently. These intermediate nesting dictionaries are now created.

## 0.9.1

#### Enhancements

* The synchronization engine integration with transport has been simplified and enhanced for more reliable behavior under poor network conditions.
* Added querying support on `lastMessage.receivedAt` from `LYRConversation`
* Performance was improved by offloading processing from the network thread.
* The `receivedAt` property for `LYRMessage` objects sent by the current user is no longer `nil`. It is now set to the same timestamp as `sentAt`.
* Querying against `LYRConversation` participants now implicitly includes the authenticated user.

#### Bug Fixes

* `LYRClient` objects will now attempt to reconnect immediately upon losing a connection even if reachability state has not changed.
* An issue where synchronization could become stalled when the app returned from the background has been fixed.
* Fixed an issue where metadata values were not validated properly, blocking the use of nested structures.
* Fixed an issue where `isUnread` and `hasUnreadMessages` did not always update appropriately during synchronization.
* Fixed an issue where `LYRConversation` objects returned via querying had a `lastMessage` value of `nil`.
* Fixed an issue that could result in database busy errors and crashes during concurrent database transactions.
* Fixed an issue where typing indicator received before a conversation was synchronized would result in a crash.
* Fixed a regression in querying for participants with certain structures of user identifiers.

#### Public API changes

## 0.9.0
